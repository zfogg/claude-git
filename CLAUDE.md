# Claude Development Guide for claude-git

This document contains important context and guidelines for Claude when working on the claude-git project.

## üéØ Project Vision

Claude-git is the **world's first professional AI-human collaborative version control system**. We're solving the critical problem of AI-generated code being completely untracked in git history, creating transparent collaboration between developers and AI with full attribution and context preservation.

## üèó Revolutionary Fork-Based Architecture

**WE ARE IMPLEMENTING A GROUNDBREAKING FORK-BASED ARCHITECTURE** - treating Claude as a proper development partner with real git workflows.

### Legacy Problems We're Solving
- ‚ùå AI-generated code appears under developer's name in git blame
- ‚ùå Claude's reasoning and context completely lost after sessions
- ‚ùå No way to review AI contributions before incorporating them  
- ‚ùå Debugging AI code becomes impossible 6 months later
- ‚ùå Teams can't distinguish human vs AI contributions
- ‚ùå Enterprise compliance and audit trails missing

### Fork-Based Architecture (IMPLEMENTING NOW)
- **True Git Fork**: `.claude-git/` is actual `git clone --reference ../` of user repo
- **Professional Integration**: Use `git merge claude/session-name`, `git cherry-pick`, `git diff`
- **AI Attribution**: Every Claude commit shows "Author: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
- **Thinking-Text Preservation**: Claude's reasoning in commit messages + git notes
- **Session Worktrees**: Each Claude session works in isolated `claude-session-{id}` branch
- **Mid-Session Branch Handling**: User switches branches ‚Üí Claude auto-commits and adapts seamlessly

### üöÄ **REVOLUTIONARY: Auto-Commit + Squash Workflow**

**The Game-Changing Approach That Solves Professional Git Integration:**

We're implementing the **most sophisticated AI-human git workflow ever created**:

**üîÑ Continuous Auto-Commit During Sessions:**
- **Every file change** Claude makes is immediately auto-committed to the fork
- **Every user change** during the session is also auto-committed with proper attribution
- **Complete change preservation** - nothing is ever lost, full audit trail maintained
- **Real-time git history** shows the actual development process as it happens

**üéØ Intelligent Session-End Squashing:**
- When Claude session ends, auto-commits are **intelligently squashed** into logical units
- **Thinking text extraction** from Claude Code transcripts becomes the commit message
- **All changes included** - user changes during session are part of the final changeset
- **Professional commit format** ready for `git cherry-pick` integration

**Example Revolutionary Workflow:**
```bash
# During active Claude session (auto-commits every change):
[auto] feat: Start user authentication - create User model
[auto] feat: Add password validation to User class  
[auto] fix: Handle user config file changes (user edit during session)
[auto] feat: Add JWT token generation method
[auto] test: Add test for JWT token validation
[auto] fix: Handle edge case for expired tokens

# Session ends ‚Üí intelligent squashing with thinking text:
git rebase -i HEAD~6  # Squash related commits
```

**Final Professional Commit:**
```
Planning authentication system - JWT middleware and validation

I started by creating a User class with proper validation methods, 
then added JWT token generation in the auth middleware. The config 
needed auth settings for token expiration and secret keys.

The user made configuration changes during our session which I've 
integrated. I handled edge cases like expired tokens and invalid 
credentials, and added comprehensive test coverage.

Files: auth.py, user.py, config.py, test_auth.py
Lines: +127, -15
Tests: +5 (all passing)
Parent-Repo: abc123def456
Session: session-789
```

**Why This Approach Is Revolutionary:**

‚úÖ **Professional Integration**: Each final commit is a complete, cherry-pickable feature
‚úÖ **Complete Changesets**: Includes ALL changes needed (Claude + user modifications)  
‚úÖ **Zero Loss**: Full development history preserved in auto-commits
‚úÖ **Audit Compliance**: Every change attributed correctly (User vs Claude)
‚úÖ **Risk Management**: Review squashed commits before integrating
‚úÖ **Standard Git Workflows**: Works with existing git tools and processes

**Pros of Auto-Commit + Squash:**
- **Perfect Integration**: Final commits are professional, ready-to-merge units
- **Complete Context**: User changes during session are included automatically
- **Flexible Choice**: Cherry-pick what you want, ignore what you don't
- **Full History**: Auto-commits preserve every step for debugging/analysis
- **No Manual Work**: Completely automated, no human intervention required
- **Git Native**: Standard git operations work perfectly

**Potential Challenges (We're Not Sure How Yet):**
- **Complex Squashing Logic**: How to intelligently group related auto-commits?
- **Branch Switch Handling**: What if user switches branches mid-auto-commit sequence?
- **Conflict Management**: How to handle conflicts during auto-commit process?
- **Performance Impact**: Will continuous auto-commits slow down large repositories?
- **Git Tool Compatibility**: Will git GUIs handle rapid auto-commit sequences well?

**Implementation Questions To Solve:**
- When exactly should auto-commits happen? (Every file save? Every tool use? Timer-based?)
- How to determine logical boundaries for squashing? (File groups? Thinking text analysis?)
- Should we use git hooks or direct git commands for auto-commits?
- How to handle user interruptions during auto-commit sequences?
- What's the rollback strategy if auto-commit + squash fails?

**Lean Towards This Approach Because:**
This solves the fundamental problem of professional AI-human collaboration in git. It provides the perfect balance of complete change tracking with professional integration workflows, making Claude a proper team member rather than an invisible code generator.

## üî• Revolutionary Features

### üß™ Real-Time Test-Driven AI Development

The **world's first AI development system with live test feedback** - Claude sees test results instantly and adapts its approach:

```bash
# REVOLUTIONARY: Live test feedback during Claude sessions
üß™ Starting pytest-testmon for session session-auth-abc123...
üìÅ Worktree: .claude-git/worktree/session-auth-main/
üëÄ Watching: *.py files for changes

üìù Claude modifies auth.py (lines 45-67)
üß™ ‚Üí Running affected tests...
‚úÖ test_user_validation PASSED (0.12s)
‚ùå test_auth_middleware FAILED - AttributeError: 'User' object

ü§ñ Claude adapts instantly:
"I need to add the is_authenticated property to the User class..."

üìù Claude modifies user.py (line 23)
üß™ ‚Üí Re-running failed tests...
‚úÖ test_auth_middleware PASSED (0.15s)

‚ú® Test-driven AI development in action!
```

### üå≥ Multi-Session Worktree Architecture

**Concurrent Claude sessions in isolated git worktrees** - multiple AI assistants working simultaneously:

```bash
# Multiple Claude sessions with perfect isolation
Session 1: .claude-git/worktree/session-auth-main/  (JWT implementation)
Session 2: .claude-git/worktree/session-ui-main/    (Component refactor)
Session 3: .claude-git/worktree/session-db-main/    (Database migrations)

# Each session has:
- Own git worktree with full project files
- Independent pytest-testmon process
- Real-time test feedback
- Session-specific branch (claude-session-abc123)
```

### Claude's Thinking as Commit Messages
Instead of technical metadata, we extract Claude's actual thinking process from Claude Code transcript files:

```bash
# OLD: Technical metadata
claude: edit auth.py
Tool: Edit
Parent-Repo: abc123

# NEW: Claude's actual thought process + test results
Planning user authentication system - need to add JWT middleware and validation

I should start by creating a User class with proper validation methods, 
then add JWT token generation in the auth middleware. The config will 
need auth settings for token expiration and secret keys.

Test Results: 12 passed, 0 failed (auth.py changes)
Affected Tests: test_jwt_generation, test_auth_middleware

Parent-Repo: abc123def456
Session: session-789
Worktree: .claude-git/worktree/session-auth-main/
Files: auth.py,user.py,config.py
```

### Dual-Repository Intelligence
- **Main repo**: User commits when they want to commit (clean history)
- **Claude-git repo**: Auto-commits EVERY change with logical boundaries
- **Perfect sync**: Files always identical between repos
- **Intelligent mapping**: Bidirectional commit relationships

## üõ† Development Guidelines

### When Working on This Codebase

1. **Understand the Transition**: We're moving from legacy to git-native architecture
2. **Remove Old Code**: Actively remove files/, metadata/, custom git implementations
3. **Git-Native First**: Always prefer standard git commands over custom implementations
4. **Hook Integration**: Use Claude Code hooks (session_start, session_end) for logical boundaries
5. **Data Redundancy**: Store data in both commit messages AND git notes for optimal querying

### Testing Strategy
Run tests to ensure the new architecture works:
```bash
# Run core tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Test git-native operations
python -m pytest tests/test_git_native_operations.py

# Test hook integration  
python -m pytest tests/test_hook_integration.py

# Test dual-repository sync
python -m pytest tests/test_repository_sync.py
```

### Code Style
- **Remove dangerous delete logic**: Never automatically delete user files
- **Git-native operations**: Use `git -C .claude-git` commands instead of custom implementations
- **Path consistency**: Always use `project_root` instead of `Path.cwd()`
- **Hook-driven commits**: Group changes into logical units using session boundaries

## üé£ Hook Integration (Critical)

**THIS IS HOW CLAUDE-GIT SHOULD WORK:**

Claude Code hooks capture Claude's thinking process in real-time and create rich commits with complete context:

### üß† Real-Time Thinking Capture Workflow

**1. Session Starts** (`~/.claude/hooks/session_start.sh`):
- Initializes session tracking in claude-git
- Records main repo state for context mapping
- Prepares to accumulate changes and thinking

**2. Claude Thinks & Works** (Automatic during session):
- Claude's thinking process is captured in transcript files
- File changes accumulate during the session
- Tool executions are tracked with timestamps

**3. Session Ends** (`~/.claude/hooks/session_end.sh`):
- Extracts Claude's complete thinking process from transcript
- Creates commit with ALL accumulated changes
- Includes conversation history in git notes
- Maps to user's main repo state

### Available Hooks
- `session_start`: Initialize session tracking and context
- `session_end`: Extract thinking + create rich commit with conversation history  
- `post_tool_use`: Track individual tool executions (optional)
- User change detection via git hooks

### Expected Commit Result
Every Claude session should produce commits like:
```bash
# Commit message contains Claude's actual thinking
Planning user authentication system - need JWT middleware and validation

I should start by creating a User class with proper validation methods, 
then add JWT token generation in the auth middleware. The config will 
need auth settings for token expiration and secret keys.

Thinking about edge cases: expired tokens, invalid credentials, rate limiting.
The user wants this to integrate with their existing OAuth setup.

Parent-Repo: abc123def456  
Session: session-789
Files: auth.py,user.py,config.py
```

```bash  
# Git notes contain full conversation + structured data
git notes show HEAD
{
  "conversation": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Help me implement authentication"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'll help you build a JWT auth system..."},
    {"role": "assistant", "thinking": true, "content": "Planning authentication system..."}
  ],
  "transcript_path": "/path/to/transcript.jsonl",
  "tool_calls": [...],
  "parent_repo": "abc123def456"
}
```

### Transcript File Access
Claude Code hooks provide access to transcript files containing:
- Claude's thinking process (`"thinking": true` messages)
- Tool executions and responses
- Session metadata and context
- Complete conversation flow

### Hook Implementation Priority ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
1. ‚úÖ **session_end**: Extract thinking text ‚Üí create meaningful commits (implemented in `session_end.py`)
2. ‚úÖ **session_start**: Record main repo context, prepare for change accumulation (implemented in `session_start.py`)  
3. ‚úÖ **post_tool_use**: Accumulate changes during Claude work (implemented in `capture.py`)
4. ‚úÖ **ai_conflict_resolution**: Use Claude Code to resolve merge conflicts automatically (implemented in `GitNativeRepository.resolve_conflicts_with_ai()`)
5. üöÄ **NEXT REVOLUTION: Real-time test integration**: pytest-testmon providing live feedback to Claude sessions
6. üöÄ **Multi-session worktree management**: Isolated git worktrees for concurrent Claude sessions
7. üöÄ **Shell command + test tracking**: Capture bash commands and test results in git notes

## üîÑ Repository Synchronization

### Critical Sync Rules
- **Files must always be identical** between main repo and claude-git repo
- **Bidirectional sync**: Main ‚Üí claude-git AND claude-git ‚Üí main
- **Conflict prevention**: User changes committed before Claude starts working
- **Logical boundaries**: Claude changes committed when session ends

### Sync Implementation
```python
def sync_repos():
    # Main repo ‚Üí claude-git (when user changes files)
    for changed_file in detect_main_repo_changes():
        copy(f"main_repo/{changed_file}", f".claude-git/{changed_file}")
        git_add_and_commit_user_change()
    
    # Claude-git ‚Üí main repo (when applying/restoring changes)  
    for changed_file in detect_claude_git_changes():
        copy(f".claude-git/{changed_file}", f"main_repo/{changed_file}")
```

## üéØ Command Implementation Priority

- [ ] **Code Review Integration**: Review AI commits before merging to main repo
- [ ] **Selective AI Integration**: Cherry-pick AI commits, skip others
- [ ] **Context Preservation**: 6-month debugging with Claude's original reasoning

## üìä Data Structure Philosophy

### Commit Messages (Human-Readable)
```
Planning authentication system - need JWT middleware and validation

I should create a User class with proper validation, then add JWT token 
generation. The config needs auth settings for token expiration.

Parent-Repo: abc123def456
Session: session-789  
Files: auth.py,user.py,config.py
Lines-Added: 47
Lines-Modified: 12
```

### Git Notes (Query-Optimized)
```json
{
  "parent_repo": "abc123def456",
  "session_id": "session-789",
  "files": ["auth.py", "user.py", "config.py"],
  "thinking": "Planning authentication system - need JWT middleware...",
  "lines_added": 47,
  "lines_modified": 12,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T14:30:00Z",
  "tool_calls": [
    {"tool": "Write", "file": "auth.py"},
    {"tool": "Edit", "file": "user.py"}
  ]
}
```

### Query Strategy
- **Fast simple queries**: `git log --grep="Parent-Repo: abc123"`
- **Complex queries**: Parse git notes JSON
- **Natural language search**: `git log --grep="authentication"`
- **File pattern search**: Notes JSON array filtering

## üö® Critical Implementation Notes

### Security & Safety
- **NEVER delete user files automatically** - user rejected this approach
- **Always check file existence** before operations
- **Use safe path operations** with proper validation
- **Respect user's main repository** - don't pollute with Claude micro-commits

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy loading**: Don't parse all git notes unless needed
- **Efficient git commands**: Use `--pretty=format:` to limit output
- **Caching strategy**: Cache transcript parsing results
- **File watching**: Efficient change detection without polling

### Error Handling
- **Graceful degradation**: Continue working if hooks fail
- **User communication**: Clear error messages and recovery suggestions
- **Rollback capability**: Always allow reverting to previous state
- **Hook failures**: Don't break Claude Code if claude-git has issues

## üéÆ Example Developer Workflows

### Problem Investigation
```bash
# Something broke after payment feature - what was Claude doing?
git log --oneline | head -5  # Find when user added payment
claude-git show-work-at abc123  # See Claude's work during that time
claude-git explain def456  # See Claude's complete thought process
```

### Selective Collaboration
```bash
# Revert to user's state with selective Claude work
claude-git revert-to-user abc123 --interactive
# ‚Üí "Include Claude's error handling? [y/n]"
# ‚Üí "Include Claude's optimization? [y/n]"
```

### Learning from Claude
```bash  
# Study Claude's problem-solving approach
claude-git search-thinking "authentication flow"
claude-git patterns --thinking
claude-git explain def456  # Read Claude's complete thought process
```

## üîß Development Commands

### Real-Time Test Integration Debugging
```bash
# Check test monitoring status
claude-git test-status --all-sessions
# Shows: pytest-testmon processes, test results, session health

# Debug test integration
claude-git test-debug session-auth-abc123
# Shows: test output, pytest-testmon logs, file watch status

# Manual test trigger
claude-git test-run session-auth-abc123 --affected-only
# Runs tests affected by session changes
```

### Multi-Session Worktree Management
```bash
# List all active session worktrees
claude-git sessions --status
# session-auth-abc123: 12 files changed, 8/10 tests passing
# session-ui-def456: 5 files changed, 15/15 tests passing

# Clean up inactive sessions
claude-git cleanup-sessions --older-than=24h

# Recover crashed session
claude-git recover-session session-auth-abc123
```

### Debugging
```bash
# Check repository sync status
claude-git status --sync-check

# Validate commit mapping integrity  
claude-git validate-mappings

# Test hook integration
claude-git test-hooks

# Show raw git notes data with test results
git -C .claude-git notes list
git -C .claude-git notes show <commit>
```

### Manual Operations
```bash
# Force repository sync
claude-git sync --force

# Rebuild commit mappings
claude-git rebuild-mappings

# Extract thinking from transcript file
claude-git extract-thinking ~/.claude/projects/*/transcript.jsonl

# Force session merge
claude-git merge-sessions session-auth-abc123 session-ui-def456 --interactive
```

## üéØ Success Metrics

This architecture will be successful when:

1. **Zero Manual Intervention**: Claude's work automatically tracked with logical boundaries
2. **Perfect File Sync**: Both repositories always contain identical files  
3. **Meaningful History**: `git log` shows Claude's actual thought process
4. **Professional Integration**: Works seamlessly with all git tools
5. **Developer Superpowers**: Users can navigate Claude's work like a professional git repository

## üöÄ Vision Statement

We're building the **first professional AI-human collaborative version control system** that treats AI as a proper development partner. Claude-git solves the critical industry problem of AI-generated code being invisible in git history.

**The Problem**: 70%+ of developers use AI daily, but AI contributions are completely untracked
**The Solution**: Professional git workflows with AI attribution, reasoning preservation, and transparent collaboration

Every commit tells a story. Every story reveals Claude's thought process. Every thought process becomes a learning opportunity for developers working with AI.

## üîß Critical Implementation: Fork-Based Init

### **New `claude-git init` Behavior**

```bash
# Current directory MUST be a git repository
cd /path/to/my-project  # Must contain .git/

# Initialize claude-git as true fork
claude-git init

# What happens:
1. Creates .claude-git/ as git clone --reference ../
2. Sets up upstream: .claude-git/$ git remote -v shows upstream: ../  
3. Copies all project files to maintain structure
4. Configures git author for Claude: "Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
5. Creates initial claude-main branch tracking upstream/main
```

**Key Requirement**: `.claude-git/` must be created **next to** `.git/` in same directory, not inside it.

---

## üß™ **META: How This Revolutionizes Claude Code Itself**

### **The Self-Improving AI Development Loop**

This architecture is **profoundly meta** - we're using Claude Code to build claude-git, which makes Claude Code better at development:

**üîÑ Real-Time Feedback Makes Claude Smarter:**
- **Instant Error Detection**: Claude sees test failures immediately, not after manual testing
- **Better Implementation Decisions**: Test results guide Claude's architectural choices
- **Quality Assurance**: Claude learns from test patterns and common failure modes
- **Faster Iteration**: No waiting for human feedback - tests provide continuous guidance

**üå≥ Multi-Session Power:**
- **Parallel Problem Solving**: Multiple Claude instances can work on different aspects simultaneously
- **Conflict Resolution Practice**: Claude gets better at merging different implementation approaches
- **Session Comparison**: Learn which approaches work better by comparing session outcomes
- **Collaborative Intelligence**: Multiple AI perspectives on the same codebase

**üìä Learning from Development History:**
```bash
# Claude can learn from its own development patterns
claude-git patterns --claude-only --topic="error handling"
# "Claude typically adds error handling after core functionality"
# "Claude's error handling improves when tests are present"

claude-git test-patterns --all-sessions
# "Sessions with real-time testing have 73% fewer bugs"
# "Test-driven sessions complete 43% faster"
```

### **Making Claude Code a Better Development Partner**

**For Users:**
- **Transparent AI Process**: See exactly how Claude approaches problems
- **Quality Guarantee**: Test-driven development ensures working code
- **Selective Collaboration**: Include only the Claude work that adds value
- **Learning Opportunity**: Study Claude's problem-solving patterns

**For Claude:**
- **Continuous Learning**: Real-time feedback improves development approach
- **Context Awareness**: Understanding the full development history
- **Better Collaboration**: Learning when to defer to user preferences
- **Quality Focus**: Test results drive better implementation decisions

**üéØ The Ultimate Goal: Symbiotic AI-Human Development**

We're creating a development environment where:
- **Claude gets smarter** from real-time feedback and multi-session learning
- **Developers get superpowers** from Claude's enhanced capabilities  
- **Code quality improves** through continuous test-driven development
- **Collaboration becomes seamless** with transparent, navigable AI work history

*This is the future of collaborative development between humans and AI.*

## ü§î Fork-Based Architecture Analysis

### **The Alternative: .claude-git as a Git Clone/Fork**

Instead of independent dual repositories, what if `.claude-git` was initialized as a proper Git clone/fork of the user's repository?

```bash
# Current: Independent repositories
main-repo/          # User's project
.claude-git/        # Separate git repo (files copied)

# Alternative: Fork relationship
main-repo/          # User's project (upstream)
.claude-git/        # Git clone of main-repo with shared history
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ origin ‚Üí ../main-repo    # Points to user's repo as remote
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main           # Tracks user's main branch
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ claude-main    # Claude's working branch  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ session-*      # Session branches with proper Git history
```

### **What We Would Gain üöÄ**

**1. Perfect Git Integration:**
```bash
# User can add claude-git as remote
cd main-repo
git remote add claude ./.claude-git
git fetch claude
git log --graph --all    # See complete interleaved history

# Professional git workflows
git diff claude/claude-main
git cherry-pick claude/session-auth-abc123
git merge claude/session-ui --no-ff
```

**2. Shared Git History:**
- Both repos share the same commit ancestry
- Natural merge/rebase workflows instead of custom sync
- Professional branching model with proper Git lineage
- All standard Git tools work seamlessly (tig, gitk, VSCode, etc.)

**3. Upstream/Downstream Model:**
```bash
# When user commits ‚Üí Claude automatically rebases
cd .claude-git
git fetch origin              # Get user's changes
git rebase origin/main claude-main  # Keep Claude's work on top

# Natural conflict resolution using Git's proven mechanisms
```

**4. Performance Benefits:**
```bash
# Use --reference for near-instant cloning
git clone --reference ../main-repo ../main-repo .claude-git
# Result: Minimal disk usage, all objects shared
```

### **What We Would Lose ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**1. Automatic Sync Complexity:**
- Need filesystem watchers for user commits
- Rebase conflicts require automatic resolution
- Race conditions during simultaneous git operations
- More complex error scenarios (failed rebases, detached HEAD, etc.)

**2. Git History Pollution Risk:**
- User's `.git` directory could be affected if not careful
- Potential for Git operations to interfere with each other
- Need to handle user's git hooks, submodules, LFS, etc.

**3. Implementation Complexity:**
- Current dual-repo is simpler: independent file copying
- Fork model requires sophisticated Git operation orchestration
- Need to handle edge cases: user rebases, force pushes, branch deletions

**4. Backward Compatibility:**
- Would need migration path from current architecture
- Complex transition for existing claude-git users

### **Critical Conflict Resolution Analysis**

**Current System (Dual-Repo):**
- Files copied between repos
- Conflicts detected by file diff comparison  
- AI resolution happens in isolation
- Simple rollback: restore file from backup

**Fork System (Shared History):**
- Conflicts occur during `git rebase origin/main claude-main`
- AI resolution must work with Git's conflict markers
- More complex rollback: `git rebase --abort`
- But: Better integration with existing Git conflict resolution tools!

### **Performance Comparison**

| Aspect | Dual-Repo | Fork-Based |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Initialization** | Fast (mkdir) | Instant (`--reference`) |
| **Disk Usage** | 2x project size | ~1x project size |
| **Sync Speed** | File copying | Git fetch (faster) |
| **Query Performance** | Custom logic | Native Git commands |
| **Tool Integration** | Limited | Perfect (all Git tools) |

### **User Experience Comparison**

**Dual-Repo UX:**
```bash
claude-git log          # Custom command
claude-git diff         # Custom implementation  
claude-git show abc123  # Custom git wrapper
```

**Fork-Based UX:**

### **Recommended Implementation Strategy üí°**

**Priority 1: Real-Time Test Integration (IMMEDIATE)**
- Implement pytest-testmon integration in worktree sessions
- Create test result feedback system for Claude Code sessions
- Build cross-session test impact analysis
- **Impact**: Immediately makes Claude 10x smarter at development

**Priority 2: Multi-Session Worktree Management (HIGH)**
- Complete session-based worktree isolation system
- Implement session recovery and cleanup mechanisms
- Build interactive session merging tools
- **Impact**: Enables concurrent Claude development workflows

**Priority 3: Fork-Based Architecture (FUTURE)**
- **The fork-based architecture is fundamentally superior** for long term
- Current dual-repo system has momentum and works well
- **Suggested approach**: Implement as `claude-git init --fork` option
- A/B test both approaches with beta users
- Migrate gradually based on real-world usage patterns

**Why This Order Makes Sense:**
1. **Test integration** provides immediate value to current architecture
2. **Multi-session worktrees** work perfectly with current dual-repo system
3. **Fork architecture** can be implemented later without breaking existing workflows
4. **User feedback** will guide the ultimate architectural decision

The AI-powered conflict resolution and real-time test feedback work brilliantly with either architecture, so we can make the final decision based on user experience and performance data.
